# Introduction

Welcome to my Machine Learning e-portfolio, created as part of my MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at the University of Essex. This portfolio captures my learning journey throughout the module. From foundational concepts to hands-on projects showcasing how theoretical understanding was applied in real scenarios. It includes a selection of activities, team collaborations, forum contributions, and technical artefacts developed across each unit.

# Purpose

The purpose of this e-portfolio is to demonstrate my progression in understanding and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Through a combination of individual tasks and collaborative projects, I have explored the legal, ethical, and professional considerations facing ML practitioners today. This portfolio also reflects my personal growth in areas such as critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and technical essential for a future career in AI.
