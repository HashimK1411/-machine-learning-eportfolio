##  Individual Contributions to Projects  
**Units Involved:** Unit 6 (Group Project)  


###  Group Project â€“ Submitted in Unit 6

During the Unit 6 group project, I played an active role in both collaborative and technical aspects of the task. I consistently participated in all team meetings and engaged constructively by contributing ideas and feedback during key decision-making discussions. My technical contributions focused on data analysis using R, where I handled parts of the exploratory analysis and supported the modelling process. I also provided input for the report, particularly in drafting and refining the sections on methodology and R-based analysis. Toward the final stages, I assisted with formatting the document and proofreading to ensure clarity and coherence before submission. These efforts reflect both my collaborative commitment and my ability to apply data analysis techniques within a real-world context.
